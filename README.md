This is an audio game that features no visuals. Turn up the volume and listen closely. Headphones recommended.

There is no menu or saving system for this game because I don't know how to code one, sorry. [sad face emoji] 
It's short enough to finish in one sitting though.

Created for BlindJam 2020.
